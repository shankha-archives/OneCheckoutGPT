✅ Let’s Build a “Unified AI Shopping Assistant”
This assistant should:

✅ Talk to the user (voice or text)
✅ Understand their needs using LLMs/NLP
✅ Recommend personalized bundles
✅ Show insights like unused benefits
✅ Capture post-purchase feedback

🚀 Updated MVP Vision: "OneSmart Assistant"
💬 “Talk. Shop. Save.”
A multimodal (voice + text) shopping agent for OneShop that recommends bundles, shows plan insights, and listens to user feedback.

💡 Additional UX Ideas to Stand Out
Voice Toggle

Let user speak: “I need a cheap phone with Netflix” → parsed → bundles shown.

Implement using Web Speech API (easy in browser).

Plan Insight Mock

Show a bar with “You have 20GB unused data – consider a cheaper plan.”

This makes it feel smart even with static data.

Post-Purchase Feedback (Optional)

Ask: “Are you happy with this recommendation?” via voice.

Use GPT to analyze sentiment and log it.

Explainability

For each bundle: “We picked this because it matches your budget, needs OTT, and offers best value.”

🛠 Tech Stack Suggestions
Layer	Tech
